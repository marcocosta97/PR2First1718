Some of the obtained calibration data is as follows:

Approximate time in one methodEntry()/methodExit() call pair:
When getting absolute timestamp only: 0,0904 microseconds
When getting thread CPU timestamp only: 0,3872 microseconds
When getting both timestamps: 0,4295 microseconds

Approximate time in one methodEntry()/methodExit() call pair
in sampled instrumentation mode: 0,0838 microseconds
